# resource-aware-automata
Energy-efficient sequence modeling using the FLaRe benchmark principles. This repository explores the hardware cost of computation on Intel/NVIDIA systems, implementing a 'Resource-Aware Selector' that balances predictive accuracy with carbon footprint by matching input complexity to model capacity.
